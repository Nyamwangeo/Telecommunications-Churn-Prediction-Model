An organization loses its customers to its competition for various reasons. What mainly attracts customers to go ahead with a shift is attributed to the price of the product and its quality. This is true for the Telecom industry as well. A churn of 10 to 60 percent in any company is a big number that can affect the companyâ€™s overall growth.

Churn is the percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service during a particular period of time. Churn category refers to the reason why a customer stops using a company's service, while churn reason refers to the specific reason for a customer to churn. In the telecom industry, multiclass classification is used to predict a customer's churn category and churn reason.

The main goal of multiclass and multilevel classification in telecom is to predict the churn category and churn reason of a customer, which can help a telecom company to take proactive measures to reduce customer churn, improve customer retention and enhance customer satisfaction. By understanding the reasons behind churn, a telecom company can develop targeted retention strategies to retain customers.

Business Impact of Churn Classification
Increase revenue with customer retention: Reduced churn means company is not losing out against it competitors and a happy customer would keep on spending money on the platform

Improve customer acquisition cost: If the company is able to stop old customers from leaving then it doesn't need to spend extra money on getting new customers or in an extreme case throw offers to get the old customer back. This impacts cost of acquisition per customer

Improve customer satisfaction: If the company is able to identify which customer will churn and reason behind that, it can fix the problem and in the end improve customer satisfaction
